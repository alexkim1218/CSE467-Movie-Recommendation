Plot
In the late 1800s, a beautiful ex-prostitute (January Jones) is trying to build an honest life with her husband Miguel in the rugged plains of New Mexico. When she catches the eye of a sadistic leader of a religious sect, Prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs), her life is violently turned upside down. She embarks upon a course of bloody vengeance with the assistance of eccentric Sheriff Cornelius Jackson (Ed Harris) who has his own violent tendencies.
